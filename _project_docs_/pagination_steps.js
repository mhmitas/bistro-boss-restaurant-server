/*
% count how many items are in db: get total number âœ“
% when i get the number of items there are in the database, i will define - how many items i will display per page . so i have set a state for items per page(created a select option to change the number of items per page dynamically). and to define the number of pages i have divided the number of items by the number of items per page | and created an array of pages --> created buttons for pages )

% 62-5 (Interesting) Set Current Page State And Next Prev Button
